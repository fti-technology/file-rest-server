REST server for file upload via HTTP
Simple API currently intended for use inside of a secure network, but security could be put in place for exposure on internet.
Build on VS2013 and Run against IIS.

After firing up the WEB API service, navigate to the URL and checkout the help to browse the API.
The purpose of this app is to reflect a local file directory to a remote directory bouncing through this server.
It is simple, by design.
